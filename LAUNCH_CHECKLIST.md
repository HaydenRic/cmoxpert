## 💡 WHAT TO BUILD NEXT

**DO NOT build more features until you have paying customers.**

After you have 5+ customers, ask them:
1. What feature would you pay 2x for?
2. What's the most frustrating part?
3. What integration do you need most?
4. What would make you recommend this to peers?

Then build based on their answers, not your assumptions.

## 🎬 RECOMMENDED DEMO SCRIPT

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi! I'm [Name], fractional CMO managing [X] B2B SaaS clients. I built cmoxpert because I was tired of juggling 5 different spreadsheets. Let me show you what I use every day."

### Dashboard (2 minutes)
"This is my client portfolio. I can see all metrics at a glance—MRR, health scores, upcoming deliverables. Click any client for deep dive."

### Client Detail (2 minutes)
"Here's one client. Performance tracking, content calendar, competitive intel—everything in one place. This report view is what I send to clients monthly."

### Content Hub (1 minute)
"When I need LinkedIn posts or blog content, AI generates it with the client's brand voice. Saves me 5+ hours per week."

### Pricing (30 seconds)
"Early access pricing is £79/month for 10 clients. First 10 users get 12 months free. Standard pricing after beta is £319/month."

### Close

Your platform is production-ready. The next step is talking to customers, not adding features.

Everything else is distraction.
