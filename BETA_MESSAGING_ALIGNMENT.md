---

## Benefit Claims vs. Reality

### Claim: "Save 10-15 hrs/week on manual reporting"

**Removed from beta page** - This was on the initial version but removed in the honest version because:
- We don't have real customer data to back this up yet
- This is a projection, not proven
- Will add back after first 5 beta users validate

**Decision:** ✅ CORRECTLY REMOVED

---

### Claim: "Multi-client support: 3-25+ clients per account"

**Current Beta Page:** Does NOT make this specific claim
**Reality:** Architecture supports unlimited clients (RLS-based multi-tenancy)
**Pricing Tiers:**
- Founding: "Unlimited clients"
- Others: "Up to 10 clients"

**Verdict:** ✅ ALIGNED - Conservative claims, proven architecture

---

## Pricing Claims vs. Capabilities

### Beta Pricing Structure

| Tier | Price | What You Get | Is This Sustainable? |
|------|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| Founding (10) | FREE 12mo + 50% lifetime | All features | ✅ Yes - feedback value > cost |
| Early (40) | $99/mo (75% off) | Up to 10 clients | ✅ Yes - $99 covers infra |
| Beta (50+) | $199/mo (50% off) | Up to 10 clients | ✅ Yes - profitable at scale |

**Standard pricing claim:** "Starting at $399/month"

**Reality Check:**
- Core features (portfolio, attribution, compliance) justify $399
- Comparable tools (HubSpot, Salesforce): $800-2000/month
- FinTech-specific features add premium

**Verdict:** ✅ ALIGNED - Pricing is justified

---

## Honest Disclaimers Included

### 1. AI Features Disclaimer
**Beta Page:** "Templates work great today. AI generation available if you add OpenAI API key (optional)."

**Why This Matters:**
- Users can use the platform without AI
- Clear that AI is optional enhancement
- No surprise "you need to pay for OpenAI" after signup

✅ **Honest**

### 2. Data Requirements
**Beta Page:** "Fraud Impact Analysis - Bring your fraud data"

**Why This Matters:**
- Clear that fraud analysis needs their data
- Not claiming we auto-detect fraud (yet)
- Sets proper expectations

✅ **Honest**

### 3. Beta Status
**Badge:** "Core Features Production-Ready"
**Footer:** "Beta program - core features production-ready"

**Why This Matters:**
- Not claiming everything is perfect
- Acknowledges beta status
- But assures core features work

✅ **Honest**

### 4. Coming Soon Section
**Yellow warning box with specific Q2 2025 roadmap**

**Why This Matters:**
- Transparent about what's NOT ready
- Gives timeline expectations
- Lets users decide if current features are enough

✅ **Honest**

---

## What's NOT on the Beta Page (Good!)

These were considered but **deliberately excluded** because they're not ready or proven:

### Not Included:
- ❌ "Save 10-15 hrs/week" - No customer data yet
- ❌ Automated competitive intelligence as "ready"
- ❌ Real-time fraud detection as "working"
- ❌ "Powered by AI" as main selling point
- ❌ Integration count boasting (only 2 work, rest are beta)
- ❌ Customer testimonials (we have none yet)
- ❌ "Trusted by X companies" (we have 0 users)
- ❌ "Join 1000+ users" fake social proof

**Verdict:** ✅ CORRECTLY OMITTED - Avoiding false claims

---

## Comparison with Current Landing Page

| Element | Main Landing (`/`) | Beta Landing (`/beta`) | Difference |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Status Badge | "Early Access Beta" | "Core Features Production-Ready" | More specific |
| Feature Claims | Lists all features | Only lists ready features | More honest |
| Coming Soon | No roadmap | Clear Q2 2025 roadmap | Transparent |
| AI Features | Prominently featured | "Optional, needs API key" | Sets expectations |
| Integrations | "Connect your tools" | "OAuth working, sync in beta" | Specific status |
| Social Proof | Beta feedback placeholders | None yet | Honest |
| Pricing | Not prominently shown | Clear 3-tier beta pricing | Transparent |

**Verdict:** Beta page is MORE honest and specific than main landing page

---

## Red Flags Check

### Common SaaS Misleading Tactics - Do We Use Them?

| Tactic | Used? | Our Approach |
|--------|-------|--------------|

| "Limited time offer" pressure | ⚠️ MILD | "Limited spots" is true (50 beta users) |
